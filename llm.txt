REPOSITORY: eb-optimization

ROLE
This repository is the optimization and parameter-tuning layer of the
Electric Barometer ecosystem.

It is responsible for learning, calibrating, and selecting parameter values
(e.g., thresholds, tolerances, adjustment bounds, policy parameters) using
historical data and evaluation outputs, and for producing reproducible,
deterministic parameter artifacts.

This repository answers: “Given historical evidence, what parameters should
be used?”
It does NOT answer: “What should we do right now?”

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES

- Parameter tuning and calibration against EB objectives:
  - tuning thresholds, tolerances, bounds, and policy parameters
  - optimizing against historical evaluation outputs and cost objectives
  - producing parameter artifacts suitable for reuse

- Optimization workflows:
  - grid search, sweep-based, or deterministic optimization routines
  - evaluation-driven optimization (metrics as objective functions)
  - reproducible experiments with explicit inputs and outputs

- Policy artifact generation:
  - emit deterministic, versioned parameter artifacts
  - artifacts are intended to be consumed by governance or execution layers,
    not interpreted here

- Clear separation of “fit” vs “apply”:
  - optimization produces parameters
  - application of those parameters happens elsewhere

---

NON-RESPONSIBILITIES (STRICT)

This repository MUST NOT:

- Execute governance decisions or bind execution behavior
- Apply RAL or perform forecast adjustments in production workflows
- Mutate or serve forecasts as a final system output
- Define metric primitives or evaluation logic
  (belongs in eb-metrics / eb-evaluation)
- Define schemas or validation contracts
  (belongs in eb-contracts)
- Train forecasting models or perform model selection
  (belongs in eb-adapters / electric-barometer)
- Perform live or online optimization

CORE INVARIANTS

- Optimization is offline and historical.
  All tuning is performed using historical data and evaluation outputs.
  No optimization occurs at execution or serving time.

- Outputs are parameters, not actions.
  The primary outputs of this repository are parameter values and artifacts,
  not decisions or adjusted forecasts.

- Determinism and reproducibility are required.
  Given the same inputs, optimization must produce the same outputs.
  Randomness must be explicit, controlled, and seedable.

- Metrics are objectives, not gates.
  Metrics may be used as objective functions during optimization, but must
  never be interpreted as pass/fail gates or authorization rules.

- Transparency over cleverness.
  Optimization routines must be explainable and auditable; opaque or
  self-modifying behavior is disallowed.

---

SYSTEM RELATIONSHIP

- This repository defers to `eb-integration/llm.system.txt` for:
  - canonical pipeline ordering
  - the rule that governance is the single binding decision layer
  - the rule that adjustment is optional and bounded

- This repository consumes:
  - eb-evaluation outputs (metrics, diagnostics, readiness signals)
  - eb-metrics primitives indirectly via evaluation outputs

- This repository produces:
  - parameter and policy artifacts to be consumed by governance or execution
    layers downstream

---

ALLOWED CHANGES

- Adding new optimization routines or tuning strategies (with tests)
- Improving optimization stability, performance, or reproducibility
- Adding new parameter artifact formats (versioned and documented)
- Extending support for new objective metrics (without redefining them)

---

DISALLOWED CHANGES

- Turning optimization outputs into implicit decisions
- Embedding governance logic or thresholds as defaults
- Applying forecast adjustments directly
- Introducing online, adaptive, or self-updating behavior
- Adding cross-repo dependencies beyond evaluation inputs

---

INTERPRETATION RULE

If the change is about learning or selecting parameter values from historical
evidence, it belongs here.
If the change is about evaluating forecasts, governing behavior, or executing
adjustments, it does not belong here.
